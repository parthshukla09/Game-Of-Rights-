                <ul>
                    <li>Article 9 specifies that an Indian citizen will lose their Indian citizenship if they voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country.</li>
                    <li>This means that if an Indian national chooses to become a citizen of another country, they automatically cease to be an Indian citizen.</li>

                </ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Implications:
                <ul>
                    <li>Losing Indian citizenship under Article 9 means the individual will no longer have the rights and privileges associated with Indian citizenship, such as voting rights, and access to Indian government services.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Implications for Citizenship Laws:
                <ul>
