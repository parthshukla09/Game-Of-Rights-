                <ul>
                    <li>It officially names the country as "India," and also recognizes the traditional name "Bharat."</li>

                    <li>India is described as a "Union of States," indicating that the states have no right to secede from the Union.</li>
                    <li>The term "Union" implies the indestructible nature of India's unity.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>While India is a federal structure with states having their own governments, the use of "Union" signifies a strong central authority.</li>

                    <li>The article reflects the strong central authority of the Union government, ensuring that changes to state boundaries or names serve national interests while still considering regional perspectives.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Article 4:</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>No Constitutional Amendment Required:
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes made under Articles 2 and 3, such as the creation of new states or altering the boundaries of existing states, do not require a constitutional amendment.</li>
                    <li>This means these changes can be made by a simple majority in Parliament, rather than the more rigorous process required for constitutional amendments.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Incorporation into the Constitution:
                <ul>
                    <li>Article 4 allows for any necessary amendments to the First Schedule (which lists the states and union territories) and the Fourth Schedule (which allocates seats in the Rajya Sabha) as a consequence of the laws made under Articles 2 and 3.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Flexible Constitutional Framework:
                <ul>
                    <li>The provision ensures flexibility in the Constitution by allowing changes to be made to the territorial and political structure of the country without the need for complex amendment procedures.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Automatic Updating of Schedules:
                <ul>
                    <li>Any law passed under Article 2 or 3 that alters the boundaries or names of states automatically updates the relevant schedules of the Constitution without needing a separate amendment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Not an Amendment under Article 368:
                <ul>
                    <li>This provision clarifies that laws made under Articles 2 and 3 are distinct from formal constitutional amendments, which require a special process under Article 368. This distinction streamlines the process of state reorganization.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
